        Hello, world. This is my first step into creating my own websites and working on developing web-ready products :)
    </body>
    

    <p>here is how to make different types of lists</p>
    <ol type="i">
        <li>First make a list with ol</li>
        <li>next set the type with type=i or(=a,=A,=1,I, or =i)</li>
        <li>Next use the li command to create new lines inside the list</li>
        <li>You can nest lists inside of eachother to make a sub-list:
            <ol type="1">
                <li>It looks just like this</li>
                <li>This line is just filler so you can see the shape</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>"Finally use "/ol" to end the list </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Here is how we make tables</p>
    <table>
        <caption>This is where you put the caption for the table</caption>
        <tr>
            <th>If you put information in a table with th then it is a header</th>
            <td>the things inside of a table like normal</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>and if text is a header it gets bolded</th>
            <td>that means you can do things like <em>This</em> inside of tables</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th colspan="2">the colspan command lets a single cell stretch along the x-axis, and the rowspan does the same for the y-axis</th>
        </tr>
    </table>
